      <h3>ABOUT MY BACKGROUND AND EXPERIENCE</h3>
      <p class="font_8">After experiencing a middle-class suburban upbringing punctuated by numerous years living in various countries in Asia, I studied psychology and philosophy, lived in France a couple of years, and eventually earned my doctorate in personality psychology at the University of Michigan in1982.  I also trained there in psychodynamic counseling and therapy. Since then, I have been a psychology professor, author, community organizer, and activist. I have played a part in the international movement to establish critical psychology, a perspective that challenges the individualism and scientism of mainstream psychology.  My books include:</p>

      <ul class="font_8">
        <li>
          <p class="font_8">Life Choices: Understanding Dilemmas and Decisions</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="font_8">Damaged Life: The Crisis of the Modern Psyche</p>

        <li>
          <p class="font_8">Critical Psychology: Voices for Change</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="font_8">Most of my academic work has aimed to foster ideology critique from a left psychoanalytic point of view, with special emphasis on dialogue practices.  A major purpose of this is to understand and remove the psychosocial obstacles to the construction of humane communities.</p>
      <p class="font_8"></p>
      <p class="font_8">My activism began with anti-nuclear and Central America solidarity work in the 1980s, Green Party organizing in the 1990s, and anti-war organizing post-9/11.  I then worked in Washington DC as the national co-coordinator of <a href="http://www.psysr.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener undefined" data-content="http://www.psysr.org" data-type="external">Psychologists for Social Responsibility</a> for four years.  Since moving to Portland, Oregon in 2004, I have worked with local sustainability projects such as <a href="http://www.tryonfarm.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener undefined" data-content="http://www.tryonfarm.org" data-type="external">Tryon Life Community Farm</a> and Transition Portland, as well as the <a href="http://www.pcasc.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener undefined" data-content="http://www.pcasc.net" data-type="external">Portland Central America Solidarity Committee</a>.  In general, I am interested in accompanying community spaces in which we can reflect on our deepest yearnings and work collectively to alter social life accordingly.</p>
      <p class="font_8"></p>
      <p class="font_8">Having been a visiting professor in Venezuela, Nicaragua, Mexico, and Costa Rica, I am fluent in Spanish and happy to work in a bilingual mode.</p>
      <p class="font_8"></p>
      <p class="font_8">I am a founding member of the <a href="http://cascadiacenter.tumblr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener undefined" data-content="http://cascadiacenter.tumblr.com" data-type="external">Cascadia Center for Social Ecology</a>, which focuses on developing support and resources for activists.  More recently, I helped establish the <a href="https://sjacportland.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener undefined" data-content="https://sjacportland.wordpress.com/" data-type="external">Social Justice Action Center</a> in Portland.</p>
